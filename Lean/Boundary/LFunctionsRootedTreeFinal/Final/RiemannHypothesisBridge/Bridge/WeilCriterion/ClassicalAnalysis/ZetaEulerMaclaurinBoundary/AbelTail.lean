# Abel tail on the boundary line

This file owns the post-cutoff Abel/Euler-Maclaurin tail estimate for
`ζ(1 + it)`.  The nonzero-frequency guard is part of the owner surface.

/-- Finite Abel-summation estimate for the post-cutoff reciprocal-weighted
logarithmic phase.

This is the finite partial-summation step: combine the first-derivative
oscillatory estimate for `∑ n^{-it}` with monotonicity of the reciprocal
weight.  Cf. Apostol, *Introduction to Analytic Number Theory*, Ch. 3. -/

/-- Abel boundary passage for the post-cutoff reciprocal-weighted logarithmic
phase.

This is the genuine limiting analytic root: finite Abel tail bounds are
transported through Abel damping and the Dirichlet-continuation boundary value
of `ζ(1 + it)`. -/

/-- Euler-Maclaurin post-cutoff tail for zeta on the boundary line, with the
nonzero-frequency guard exposed.

The infinite tail is the Abel boundary value of the reciprocal-weighted
logarithmic phase after transporting back to the boundary-line Dirichlet
monomial. -/
